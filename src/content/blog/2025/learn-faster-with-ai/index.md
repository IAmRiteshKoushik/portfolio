## Overview
I am writing this blog to jot down a couple of pointers to learn properly and deeply 
in this age of AI. While there are many lists on the internet that address
this, I find the following to have worked the best for me as a student and as a 
programmer. This goes beyond mindlessly consuming content of books, blogs, 
youtube videos. It is my attempt to streamline resources into a single consumable 
pipeline which makes it easy to extract knowledge and add value.

## Why Are You Learning ?
Learning for most people has become a form of mental masturbation. It is 
comparable to the dopamine hits that you get from scrolling on your phone except
it makes you feel that you have learned something. The reality is that you would 
forget the intricate details of it by tomorrow and only remember enough to 
name-drop it during conversations.

## Draw the Outline, Build the Project
Often times we choose to learn something new as an exploratory measure without 
having it connect to any of our existing skills, needs or goals. Learning 
accelerations come only to those, who have a deeper meaning and clarity behind 
why they would like to learn something. 

> People who enjoy learning something outperform those who are innately smarter. 

Now the best way to learn something is by building something in the real-world 
and then hunt for information that is relevant to you as and when you need it.
Watching endless tutorials fills your mind with noise and chaos which you cannot
seem to bring order about. We have often thrown around the word **tutorial hell**
and that is what this is about. The lack of a project with a deadline allows 
in all kinds of information. An argument which is often presented is to have 
sufficient amount of knowledge and pre-requisite before getting started with 
a project. While this may apply to some very niche domains with a resource 
constraint, it does not really apply to most others given how we are living in 
the **age of abundance**. 

Another compelling reason that most people have for being stuck in a tutorial 
phase is learning to do things the right way the first time around. It is my 
belief that this thinking of getting it right the first time around and 
avoiding re-writing and refactoring has often lead to far slower growth and 
gaining of experience. One ought not to shy away from writing **scrappy** versions
of their project. Something that doesn't work too well. Something that is held 
together with duck-tape. Something that does not scale!

When you are learning something new, you must consicously choose to build things 
that do not cover all general cases but just does the intended job. Your 
analytical mind would perhaps scream at you for intentionally leaving out 
inadequacies but you must remember than you are not a child succumbing to the 
machinations of your mind. It ought to be in your control. Understand the 
trade-off. Silence the critic and solve the problem in front of your eyes. Build 
that proof-of-concept and validate your idea before thinking of 10 different 
problems that do not exist already.

In short, lay your outlines properly! Write them down as 3 goals you have for a 
project and anything and everything that does not supplement those 3 goals 
strongly, do not require your attention!

## How to Optimize for Pattern Recognition
> We recognize patterns only when we are looking for them. 

This is often an overlooked aspect of learning but we learn best when we are 
asking the right questions and are looking answers for them. Often times, we 
think of our brain as a pool and knowledge as a liquid filling that pool; but 
in reality a more accurate picturization would be to think of the brain as a 
mass of **LEGO blocks**. Every piece of information that is assimilated must 
fit in this structure but for it to fit, you need to allow it the appropriate 
grooves that it can grasp on to. When you do not have the right questions, you 
are missing the grooves and knowledge, like the LEGO blocks that they are, 
just fall off.

At this stage, something practical and actionable to do would be to break down 
your tasks into a list of micro-tasks and prompt AI to give you a list of 
questions that you could find answers to and thereby learn the underlying concept.
Bear in mind that the initial set of questions would in no way be the perfect 
and exhaustive list. But finding answers to them could lead to better questions 
and help you form the mental grooves to assimilate knowledge.

Pattern recognition is impossible when you are starting from a blank slate. You need 
something on the plate to feed off of. Allow AI to generate that initial fooder
and then put it away as your consume silently before getting back, sharing your 
learning and progress and hunting for the next set of questions. Make sure to 
never ask for complete answers directly. Resources and snippets only.

## The Fortnight Learner

Learning happens best when there is only one thing to learn. Fragmented focus 
has always lead to distractions. However, you do need to take breaks, try out 
different things for a change and sometimes just explore the wild. The important 
question here would be, how much time to give to something before re-evaluating 
our perspective on it ?

And that is where the **2-weeks** theory steps in. We grossly underestimate how 
much can be done in a time period of 2 weeks and overestimate how much can be 
done in 6 months. As human beings, we cannot quantify the velocity of resolving 
roadblocks while not losing sight of the big picture. Locking ourselves in a 
2 week timeline takes away the cognitive load that comes from constantly having 
to context switch between not losing sight of the big picture while giving 
sufficient attention to the immediate problem. This is because there is only so 
much room to veer off on a tangent when you have such a short-time to work on 
something and build the necessary mental models and patterns for it.

Here, once again, you can leverage AI by asking it to create a 2 week plan 
in order for you to pick up a stack of things. The prompt ought to invovle asking 
AI to keep it simple, lean and yet making sure that the density of knowledge 
consumed is thick. A way to structure your prompt would be to get AI to be the 
following for you:
1. A strategic mentor (initial set of questions)
2. A discipline coach (2 weeks only) 
3. A study regiment (guardrails of how much diversion you can afford)

## Deploy In The Wild

The second dose of motivation after the initial spurt comes often when you have 
things that are broken. But not every broken thing needs to be fixed. Our minds 
are quite incapable at fixing the broken parts of our project as we often 
gravitate towards what we find the easiest to fix rather than what is important.
And this is where getting real-world feedback on your project is important. We 
fixate on the is truly important when it becomes a pain point for somebody else.

The broken bits that are truly important are the ones that hurt! As the 
architect of a project, often times it is easier to be told to fix something and 
then allow the **tunnel vision** to re-create your new cycle of 2-weeks.

So we continue. Another conversation with AI. Another list of things 
to do. Another learning cycle. Overtime, your iteration cycles get faster, the 
knowledge compunds and you mature alongside your project.
